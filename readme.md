Description
===========

This plugin is build especially for clients back in 2011. It uses custom posts to store data and ejunkie for storing digital downloads. Also someone managed to use this together with amazon S3 storage.

This plugin really needs a rewrite to use amazon S3 and paypal so you can leave out ejunkie.
